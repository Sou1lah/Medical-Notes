## What cells need

To understand the critical importance of the <mark style="background:#fff88f">heart</mark> requires taking a step back so we understand the needs of each cell in our body.  Remember that our body is <mark style="background:#fff88f">composed of over 10 trillion cells</mark> that work together in remarkable unity (a lesson in good governance!).  Cells have basic <mark style="background:#fff88f">needs</mark>, and at the top of the list would be these four things:

1) <mark style="background:#fff88f">access to oxygen</mark>

2) a <mark style="background:#fff88f">source of glucose</mark>

3) a <mark style="background:#fff88f">balanced fluid</mark> environment with the right amount of <mark style="background:#fff88f">water/electrolytes</mark>

4) <mark style="background:#fff88f">removal of waste</mark> (such as carbon dioxide)

Consider how this compares to basic human needs: breathing air in and breathing out, eating food, drinking water, and getting rid of urine/stool. When you really stop and think about it, many of the things that we do can be traced back to our cellular needs.

## A breath of air
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
  <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/c378c2b2001cf9391c1645205513b445bb1b12f2.png" alt="Lungs illustration" style="margin-right: 20px;">
  <p style="max-width: 400px;">Figure 1: The lungs are composed of a few hundred million tiny air sacs called alveoli, each of which are surrounded by a network of blood vessels (capillary bed) which carry deoxygenated blood, shown in blue, and carry out oxygenated blood, shown in red. (Adapted from Wikipedia image)</p>
</div>

Now let’s follow a single breath of air. <mark style="background:#fff88f">21% of the molecules</mark> in this breath are <mark style="background:#fff88f">oxygen</mark> molecules, and as they race down into the lungs, they end up in the <mark style="background:#fff88f">alveoli</mark> which are <mark style="background:#fff88f">tiny air-filled sacs</mark>.  The story could end there, if not for the remarkable nature of lungs.  The lungs allow the <mark style="background:#fff88f">oxygen</mark> molecules to <mark style="background:#fff88f">continue</mark> their journey from the <mark style="background:#fff88f">gas phase</mark> into a new <mark style="background:#fff88f">liquid phase</mark>. Meanwhile <mark style="background:#b7ebc6">carbon dioxide</mark> molecules make the <mark style="background:#b7ebc6">opposite trip</mark> from <mark style="background:#b7ebc6">liquid to gas</mark> similar to what happens at the surface of a carbonated beverage. The <mark style="background:#fff88f">oxygen diffuses</mark> (think of the drop of ink in a pool of water) <mark style="background:#fff88f">into the fluid interstitial space of the lung</mark>, and is then <mark style="background:#fff88f">absorbed into the blood stream</mark>, and then enters into the red blood cells themselves. This diffusion occurs in a fraction of a second because the distance between the alveoli and the red blood cell is so tiny.

If the white balls represent O2 molecules, then this illustrates how random movements allow O2 to move from an area of high concentration (alveoli) to an area of low concentration (blood)—a process called diffusion.

## Why you need your heart

While <mark style="background:#fff88f">air</mark> is going <mark style="background:#fff88f">in</mark> and <mark style="background:#fff88f">out</mark> of the <mark style="background:#fff88f">lungs</mark>, the heart is busy working as well. <mark style="background:#ffecb5">Blood enters</mark> the heart through the <mark style="background:#ffecb5">superior and inferior vena cava</mark>, which are the large veins that bring blood back from the top and bottom of the body respectively. Then, the <mark style="background:#ffecb5">blood remains</mark> in the <mark style="background:#fff88f">right atrium</mark>, which can be thought of as a <mark style="background:#fff88f">waiting room</mark> for the <mark style="background:#fff88f">right ventricle</mark>. The right ventricle (pump #1) has <mark style="background:#fff88f">muscular walls</mark> that <mark style="background:#fff88f">squeeze down</mark> and <mark style="background:#b7ebc6">softly push</mark> the blood into the <mark style="background:#b7ebc6">arteries, arterioles, and capillaries</mark> of the <mark style="background:#fff88f">lungs</mark>. Next, the <mark style="background:#fff88f">oxygen diffuses</mark> from an area of <mark style="background:#fff88f">high concentration (alveoli)</mark> to an area of <mark style="background:#fff88f">low concentration (blood)</mark>, before the blood returns (through pulmonary veins) to the left of the heart. Just like the right atrium, the <mark style="background:#fff88f">left atrium</mark> can be thought of as a waiting room for the <mark style="background:#fff88f">left ventricle</mark>. The left ventricle is a room with even stronger, thicker, and more muscular walls than the right ventricle. As a result, the left ventricle (pump #2) forcefully pushes the blood through the arteries and capillaries of the body to get to the trillions of cells in need of oxygen. For the return trip, blood travels through the veins of the body to get back to the right side of the heart and repeat the process. So there you have it – one heart – two pumps: the right ventricle and the left ventricle.

## Why are there two ventricles?

Now here’s a thought experiment: *Why not just have just one ventricle (single pump) that moves blood to the lungs and then onwards to the rest of the body?*
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
  <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/e8e4b12481b6461485a90d56014c0c8bd0ae7bf4.png" alt="Double ventricle illustration" style="margin-right: 20px;">
  <p style="max-width: 400px;">Figure 4: The heart functions as a double ventricle. Blood moves from the body into the right atrium, and then into the right ventricle where it gets pumped into the lungs. Blood gets oxygenated in the lungs, moves into the left atrium, and into the left ventricle where it gets pumped into the body again.</p>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
  <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/2cab7db2dcbf1a6a9f706ea3fafda05ee8fd626e.png" alt="Single ventricle illustration" style="margin-right: 20px;">
  <p style="max-width: 400px;">Figure 5: This diagram shows the heart as having a single atrium and single ventricle. Blood moves from the body into the atrium, and then into the ventricle where it gets pumped into the lungs, gets oxygenated, and then goes back to the body again.</p>
</div>


It’s actually a great question, since at first glance it seems like it would be more efficient to just allow the blood to go out to the body instead of taking a return trip to the heart. Think of it this way using numbers. Pressure is needed to move blood through the resistance of a large network of blood vessels like arteries, capillaries, and veins. Even if the right ventricle squeezes down and raises the pressure of the blood to about 25mmHg, after passing through the lungs, the blood pressure is back down to about 5mmHg (a reduction of 20mmHg). It goes into the left ventricle where it gets a second squeeze causing the pressure to rise back up to about 120mmHg (almost 5 times the pulmonary pressure!). That’s enough pressure to make it through all of the organs in the body.

## Getting the pressure right

Now, let’s say that the right ventricle raised the pressure up to 140mmHg, then you may be able to have the blood pressure drop 20mmHg and still be at 120mmHg. That sounds like a great solution, except for the fact: 1. *If exposed to those high pressures, fluid would get pushed right out of the capillaries and into the lungs (some capillaries would actually break!),* and 2.*At high pressures, blood would move past the alveoli so quickly that O2 molecules wouldn't have time to diffuse into the blood and bind to hemoglobin.* This makes sense when you remember that none of the capillaries in the body are exposed to extremely high pressures (120-140mmHg), because by the time blood gets down to the capillaries it has already passed through arteries (and arterioles), and the pressure has dramatically fallen. Having lower pressures in the pulmonary circulation is particularly important given the large amount of O2 that needs to diffuse across from the alveoli to the capillaries—every extra millisecond helps!

That’s why the human body needs two pumps working at different pressures, high pressure to allow the blood to circulate around the body, and low pressure to allow for optimal gas exchange in the lungs without broken capillaries!
