## The Journey of Oxygen (O²)

The path follows a "pipeline" that gets smaller as it goes deeper into the body. 

1. Entry & Pre-processing (Upper Tract) 

- **Nose/Nostrils:** Air enters here. It is **filtered** by hairs (cilia), **warmed**, and **moistened** to protect the delicate lungs.

> The nasal cavity is the internal part of the nose. The openings that allow air to enter are called nares. At the back of the nasal cavity, there are two openings called choanae that open into the nasopharynx. There are 12 small bones in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity plays a role in breathing and smelling.

- **Pharynx (Throat):** A shared corridor for air and food.
- **Larynx (Voice Box):** Contains the **epiglottis**, a flap that acts as a switch to ensure air goes to the lungs and food goes to the stomach.

> The larynx is located in the front of the neck, just in front of the esophagus and above the trachea. Comprised of cartilage, it connects at the upper end to the pharynx and at the lower end to the trachea. The larynx transports air from the pharynx to the trachea and contain the vocal cords, which make speech possible.


2. The Main Pipeline (Lower Tract) 

- **Trachea (Windpipe):** A sturdy tube held open by **cartilage rings** so it doesn't collapse.
- **Bronchi:** The trachea splits into two main branches—one for the **left lung** and one for the **right lung**.

> The trachea transports air from from the lower end of the larynx into the upper chest, where it divides into two branches (bronchi) that connect to the lungs. Structurally, the trachea is made up of open-sided cartilage rings that are connected by a band of muscle that contracts during sneezing.


3. The Branching Network

- **Bronchioles:** Inside the lungs, the bronchi branch into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes (like tree branches).

- **Alveoli:** The "dead end" of the branches. These are tiny, grape-like air sacs where the "magic" happens.

4. The Final Delivery (Gas Exchange) 

- **Diffusion:** Oxygen moves from the **alveoli** into the **capillaries** (tiny blood vessels) by a process called diffusion—moving from high concentration to low concentration.
- **Hemoglobin:** Once in the blood, oxygen molecules "latch on" to **hemoglobin** inside **red blood cells**.
- **Systemic Flow:** This oxygenated blood travels to the heart, which then pumps it to the rest of your body.

> The diaphragm is a sheet of skeletal muscle located in the chest that helps breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts to create a vacuum that pulls air into the lungs. On exhalation, it relaxes and pushes air from the lungs. The diaphragm is also the border that separates the chest from the abdomen.
